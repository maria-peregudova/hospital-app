# hospital-app
This code will help monitor the state of patients currently in a hospital.

Currently the main.cpp program is the main code and the other source and header files need to be linked, because they contain the class definitions and function declarations.

During work the program will generate a file with patient information, which will be used to store it until needed. 

In case of using the function which checks if the code works correctly a file with errors will be generated, if it is not generated or left blank there were no errors.

The code works in console and currently has no GUI, to interract with it you need to input the number of the option you choose and other parameters when asked to. 

WARNING! the temperature is stored in format 36.6 C -> 366, 40.1 -> 401
